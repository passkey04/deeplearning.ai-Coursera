# deeplearning.ai-Coursera
Weekly assignments of Deeplearning.ai
# Best projects includes:
# Course-4 :Art Generation of Neural Style Transfer</br>

• Used Transfer learning by taking a VGG-19 network which is pretrained on ImageNet database to get the features.</br>
• Used activations from various layers of that pretrained network to get the required Image.</br>
• Computed the content cost by taking normalised mean square differences of some intermediate activation layer.</br>
• Used activations from various layers to compute the style cost. It is calculated by taking the co relation across various channels using gram matrix.</br>
• The entire implementation of the model was done using Keras and Tensorflow.</br>
# Course-4: Autonomous Driving Applications: </br>
Implemented car detection using YOLO algorithm.</br>
• Pretrained weights are used for testing the model. </br>
• Thresholding was used to remove unwanted boxes after applying the YOLO algorithm.</br>
• Non max Suppression was used to select the right boxes and to eliminate the boxes with high overlap.</br>
# Course-4: Face recognition and Verification using CNN (Uses of ResNET-50) </br>
Implemented Face recognition using FaceNet algorithm which learns a neural network to a face image to a vector of 128 numbers. </br>
• Used Inception model to get the encoding of the faces.</br>
• Implemented Triplet loss function which is used for training the model so the model encoding the same person will be similar and different persons will be very different.</br>
• Used the pretrained model to test Face verification( 1:1 matching )as well as Face recognition(1:K matching).</br>
• To improve the efficiency of the model, encodings of the faces are stored instead of computing everytime which can be used for comparison.</br>
# Course-5: Sequence Models </br>
• ALl assignments are cool especially emojify and Trigger word detection.
# For further on COnvolutional Neural Networks some papers are included (espcially on gender and age detection)
